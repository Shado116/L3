The Murders and the Investigation
---------------------------------

Between August and November 1888, **five canonical victims** were
murdered in Whitechapel. Each case shared elements of method and
mutilation that suggested a single perpetrator.

Despite the narrow time frame, the police failed to identify the killer.
Theories proliferated, suggesting he might be:

-  a **surgeon or butcher** with anatomical knowledge,

-  a **religious fanatic** seeking to “cleanse” Whitechapel,

-  or even a **member of the aristocracy**, as popular rumor had it.

The investigation was hampered by poor coordination between the
**Metropolitan Police** and the **City of London Police**, and by a
press hungry for headlines rather than truth. Letters allegedly written
by “Jack the Ripper” to the police and media—such as the infamous *“Dear
Boss”* letter—only deepened the mythos.
