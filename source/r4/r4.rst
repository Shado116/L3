historical enigma and a psychological mirror**. His story is retold in
books, films, and academic studies, each reflecting the fears of its
era. Scholars analyze the Ripper case through the lenses of:

-  **Gender:** The murders expose Victorian misogyny and systemic
   violence against women.

-  **Class:** The victims’ poverty revealed the indifference of the
   elite.

-  **Media studies:** The Ripper was the first criminal “celebrity”
   created by mass communication.

The fascination persists because the Ripper’s identity remains unknown.
The mystery allows audiences to project their own anxieties—about power,
sexuality, and morality—onto a faceless killer. The case thus transcends
mere crime: it becomes a meditation on the human attraction to evil and
the societal need to name it.
