Introduction
-------------

Few figures in criminal history have captured the public imagination
quite like **Jack the Ripper**, the unidentified serial killer who
terrorized London’s East End in 1888. The Ripper murders, though
confined to a brief period of time and a small geographic area, have
spawned more speculation, investigation, and cultural mythology than
perhaps any other crime in modern history. The case represents not only
a horrifying series of murders but also a fascinating intersection of
**Victorian society, media sensationalism, and the psychology of fear**.
