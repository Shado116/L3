The Historical Context: London’s Dark Underbelly
------------------------------------------------

To understand the legend of Jack the Ripper, one must first grasp the
**social landscape of Victorian London**. The East End, particularly the
district of Whitechapel, was a microcosm of urban poverty, overcrowding,
and moral decay. Streets teemed with beggars, prostitutes, and
immigrants living in squalid conditions.

Key features of the East End in 1888 included:

-  **Overpopulation:** Up to 900 people per acre in some districts.

-  **Extreme poverty:** Many residents survived on casual labor or
   prostitution.

-  **Lack of sanitation:** Open sewers and rampant disease.

-  **Moral hypocrisy:** The respectable classes ignored the social
   conditions that produced vice.

In this environment, the Ripper’s victims—mostly destitute women engaged
in prostitution—were tragically invisible. Their deaths only gained
attention because of the **unprecedented brutality** and surgical
precision of the killings, which shocked Victorian sensibilities and
exposed the darkness beneath London’s polished veneer.
