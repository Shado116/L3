Conclusion
----------

Jack the Ripper was not merely a murderer; he was a **symbolic rupture
in the Victorian psyche**. His crimes illuminated the fractures within a
society obsessed with progress yet blind to its own decay. The Ripper’s
legend endures because it speaks to something timeless: humanity’s
uneasy relationship with the darkness within itself.

| In an era where true crime remains one of the most consumed media
  genres, the Ripper’s shadow reminds us that curiosity about evil often
  says more about us than about the killer himself.
